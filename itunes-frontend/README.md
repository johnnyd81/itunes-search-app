# iTunes Search Api

## App Description

This application allows a user to search for items on the iTunes and Apple Books store. A search term can be
entered in the input field, a media type can also be selected and then it can be searched by clicking search.
A favourites button takes a user to page that contains all the items that were selected as favourites. On the
favourites page if a user decides to remove a favourite then the item can be removed by clicking on the delete
button.

1. Clone/Download the project to your computer.
2. In the command terminal cd into the itunes-search directory.
3. Enter 'npm install'.
4. To install the frontend enter 'cd itunes-frontend' and then enter 'npm install'.
